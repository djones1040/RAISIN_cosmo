;  demo20: Importance sampler showing Planck likelihood combined with
;  supernovae.


[runtime]
sampler = importance

;  Importance sampling is a general method for estimating quantities from
;    one distribution, P', when what you have is samples from another,
;    similar distribution, P. In IS a weight is calculated for each sample
;    that depends on the difference between the likelihoods under the two
;    distributions.
;
;    IS works better the more similar the two distributions are, but can
;    also be useful for adding additional constraints to an existing data
;    set.
;
;    There's a nice introduction to the general idea in Mackay ch. 29:
;    http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/itila/book.html
